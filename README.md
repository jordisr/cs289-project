This analysis depends on the biopython library, as well as several bioinformatics tools and databases:
* Python 3 and Biopython
* DSSP (for secondary structure)
* BLAST suite and the SwissProt sequence database (for conservation, available from the NCBI)
* MAFFT or other multiple sequence alinger (for conservation)
